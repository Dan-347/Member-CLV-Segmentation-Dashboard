# Member CLV Segmentation Dashboard
This dashboard was developed as the final result of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis and customer segmentation using a combination of probabilistic models (BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma) and unsupervised learning (K-Means based on LRFM + CLV). This dashboard aims to help the Marketing and Data teams at Retail XYZ understand customer characteristics from two main perspectives, namely historical behavior (LRFM) and future economic value potential (CLV value).

Through this dashboard, users can visually view customer segmentation, understand the differences between each segment, and identify customer groups that have strategic value for the business.

## Background
In the business world, customers are an important aspect that determines the sustainability of a company's business. Not only as a source of income, customers also play a major role in contributing to and reflecting the value brought to the company's development, whether through activities, interactions, feedback, or loyalty. Every activity carried out by customers provides deep insights into their behavior and purchasing preferences. Understanding these insights gives companies the ability to optimize their marketing strategies, increase customer loyalty, and develop and offer products or services that meet customer needs. Data such as customer activities or transactions contain important information that can be the most valuable asset for companies in understanding these insights to support operational success and decision-making processes. Information from customer activity data also helps companies identify patterns or trends that may emerge from customer interactions with the business.

Based on the results of surveys and interviews at XYZ retail,  currently, the marketing team in particular is having difficulty understanding customer quality and behavior, as well as identifying high-value customers. The team also finds it difficult to know which customers to retain or target in a marketing campaign, so marketing strategies are often general and less targeted, risking inefficient promotion budget allocation, decreased customer retention, and loss of potential revenue from high-value customers. In addition, the company does not yet have a visualization tool that can help monitor and evaluate changes in customer behavior and value. Therefore, the marketing team needs a solution that can help them analyze customer data more effectively and efficiently.

## Objectives
This project was developed with the aim to:
1. Integrating analytical methods with dashboards to present complex information in a simpler and more understandable way for non-technical users.
2. Identify and predict customer value, both in terms of revenue and future growth potential.
3. Segmenting customers based on similar behavior patterns and values, forming customer groups with unique characteristics.
4. Designing interactive visualizations that present customer CLV information.

## Why This Analysis Matters
The benefits that can be provided in this project are as follows:
1. Providing insight into the characteristics of each customer segment and its contribution to the company.
2. Assist the marketing team in identifying potential customers to determine effective and efficient marketing strategies to improve customer satisfaction.
3. Improve customer retention and reduce churn risk, while encouraging customer loyalty.
4. Assisting companies in predicting revenue and measuring the future Return on Investment (ROI) they will receive.
5. Optimizing resource allocation based on an understanding of customer behavior, so that business strategies are more targeted.
6. Supporting more accurate decision-making through a data-driven approach by providing comprehensive insights into customer behavior and values.

This dashboard is highly relevant for:
1. Marketing Team → creating promotion and retention strategies
2. CRM/Customer Success → determining differentiated treatment for each segment
3. Data Team → monitoring customer behavior
4. Management → viewing a macro overview of customer value
